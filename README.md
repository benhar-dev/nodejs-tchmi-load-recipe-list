## Overview

This is a small example of accessing the TcHmi API to interact with recipes. This is a proof of concept to show that you could manage your recipe data via a node.js script. This could be adjusted to create, delete, check recipe data from an external system.

## Getting started

You must have node.js installed on your system

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the command prompt to .\src\ and type `npm install`
3. Open a TwinCAT HMI project which uses recipes in live view.
4. Copy the liveview URL and paste this in to the index.js constant WEBSITE_URL

```js
npm start
```
